## Introduction
The face recognition attendance tracking system is becoming increasingly popular as a security measure in various industries. This system can be used to track attendance, verify identities, and even control access to secure areas. In this project, Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Face recognition library were used to develop a face recognition attendance tracking system. The project also integrated the code with Arduino to develop a security system by connecting a fingerprint scanner and solenoid lock, thereby creating a double protection door lock security system with face recognition and fingerprint validation.
## Abstract
This project presents an implementation of a face recognition attendance tracking system utilizing state-of-the-art technologies such as Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Face recognition library. The system employs real-time video streams to detect and recognize faces, compare them with known faces, and display the name of the recognized individual. Furthermore, the system is integrated with an Arduino board to create a double protection door lock security system with face recognition and fingerprint validation. The project loads a pre-trained CNN model, loads image encodings for face recognition, and initializes video capture for facial detection. The system compares the detected faces with the known face encodings, sets the name if the confidence exceeds the threshold, draws a box around the face, and displays a label with the name below the face. The user can exit the system by hitting 'q' on the keyboard. This project demonstrates how cutting-edge technology can be utilized to improve security and attendance tracking in various industries.
## Conclusion
The face recognition attendance tracking system is a great technology that can help improve security in various industries. This project has demonstrated the use of Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Face recognition library to develop a face recognition attendance tracking system. The integration of the system with Arduino to develop a security system by connecting a fingerprint scanner and solenoid lock has also added an extra layer of security to the system. Overall, this project has shown how technology can be used to improve security and make life easier.
